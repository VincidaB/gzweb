 * The Websocket Loading Manager is a custom Loading Manager that keeps track

 * Usually, when a loader fails to load an item, it marks it as done. This
 * manager handles that particular case: It doesn't mark the item as done
 * until it comes back from the websocket connection.
 *
 * Loading Managers handle and keep track of loaded and pending items.
 * For more information, see https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager
